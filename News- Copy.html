            <h1>13 December 2022</h1>
        <p>On Tuesday, December 13, 2022, Al-Nahda University organized for its students a field trip to Children’s 
            Cancer Hospital 57357. Students of the Faculties of Pharmacy, Computer Science and Business Administration participated 
            in this fieldtrip, 
            who contributed to providing moral support and drawing a smile on children’s faces, as the students 
            participated in many recreational activities, as well as Distributing gifts and toys to children to
            bring happiness to their hearts.
            The Public Relations Officer accompanied the students on a tour of the hospital corridors and gave 
            them an overview of the hospital and clinics, the mechanism of work in them, and the importance of 
            these fieldtrips in improving the psychological condition of patients. At the end of the fieldtrip,
            the students were keen to make a financial donation in favor of the hospital.   
            This field trip coincided with the initiatives and invitations launched by many public figures and 
            artists to urge them to fieldtrip the hospital, donate for children to help them complete their medical 
            treatment, and help the hospital keep its doors open.</p>
